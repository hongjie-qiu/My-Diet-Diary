## Descrption 
MyDietDiary is our team project for the course INFO 340 - Web Programming.  
Our group decided to focus on tracking BMI data and diet plans because we noticed that people's eating  
habits in modern days lack specific categories of food, with mostly only fat, starch, and sugar for a meal.  
Busy schedules also lead to people eating on the run, which results in poor nutritional intake.  
We hope MyDietDiary will help users achieve a healthier lifestyle by monitoring BMI results  
and tracking daily food intake.
